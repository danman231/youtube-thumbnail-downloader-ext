Placeholder for icon files:

You'll need to create the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons should be PNG format with transparency.
You can use a tool like GIMP, Photoshop, or an online icon generator to create these files.

Suggested design: A simple downward-pointing arrow overlaid on a YouTube play button or thumbnail frame.
