# YouTube Thumbnail Downloader - Implementation Progress

## Overall Progress
- [x] Step 1: Set up the Extension Structure (March 30, 2023)
- [ ] Step 2: Add the Context Menu Item
- [ ] Step 3: Listen for the Context Menu Click
- [ ] Step 4: Extract the Video ID from the Thumbnail URL
- [ ] Step 5: Download the Thumbnail
- [ ] Step 6: Create the Popup with Instructions (basic version already implemented in Step 1)

## Current Status
- Basic extension structure is in place
- Files created:
  - manifest.json
  - background.js (empty service worker)
  - popup.html (basic structure)
  - icons/ directory with README.txt

## Next Steps
- Implement context menu functionality in background.js
- Set up event listeners for user interactions

## Technical Debt / Issues
- Need to create actual icon files (currently only placeholders)
- May need to implement error handling in future steps

## Testing Status
- Basic structure has been loaded in Chrome in Developer mode
- Extension appears in the list of installed extensions
- No functional tests have been performed yet as functionality hasn't been implemented
