# YouTube Thumbnail Downloader - Implementation Progress

## Overall Progress
- [x] Step 1: Set up the Extension Structure (March 30, 2023)
- [x] Step 2: Add the Context Menu Item (March 30, 2023)
- [x] Step 3: Listen for the Context Menu Click
- [x] Step 4: Extract the Video ID from the Thumbnail URL
- [ ] Step 5: Download the Thumbnail
- [ ] Step 6: Create the Popup with Instructions (basic version already implemented in Step 1)

## Current Status
- Basic extension structure is in place
- Files created or updated:
  - manifest.json
  - background.js (now with context menu implementation, click handler, and video ID extraction)
  - popup.html (basic structure)
  - icons/ directory with placeholder icon files
  - create_icons.js (script to generate placeholder icons)
- Context menu successfully shows items for YouTube thumbnails
- Click handler implemented that logs thumbnail URLs to console
- Video ID extraction function implemented and successfully extracting IDs from various YouTube URL formats

## Next Steps
- Set up download functionality (Step 5)

## Technical Debt / Issues
- Current icon files are minimal placeholders and should be replaced with proper designed icons
- May need to implement error handling in future steps

## Testing Status
- Extension has been loaded in Chrome in Developer mode
- Extension appears in the list of installed extensions
- Context menu items appear when right-clicking on YouTube thumbnails/videos
- Context menu items do not appear when right-clicking on non-YouTube images
- Click handler successfully logs URLs to the console
- Video ID extraction correctly parses and logs IDs from YouTube URLs
