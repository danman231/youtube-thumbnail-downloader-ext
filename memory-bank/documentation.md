# YouTube Thumbnail Downloader - Documentation

## Changes Summary

### March 30, 2023 - Initial Setup (Step 1)

1. Created `manifest.json` (lines 1-14)
   - Defined extension metadata with Manifest V3
   - Added required permissions: "contextMenus", "downloads"
   - Configured service worker and popup
   - Referenced icon files
   - Reason: Establishes the core configuration for Chrome extension functionality

2. Created empty `background.js` (lines 1-3)
   - Added placeholder comments for future implementation
   - Reason: Will contain context menu and download functionality in subsequent steps

3. Created `popup.html` (lines 1-19)
   - Built basic HTML structure
   - Added inline CSS for styling
   - Included simple user instructions
   - Reason: Provides user interface when extension icon is clicked

4. Created `icons/` directory
   - Added `README.txt` with instructions for icon creation
   - Reason: Placeholder for extension icons needed at various resolutions

5. Updated directory structure
   - Organized files according to Chrome extension best practices
   - Created future-proof folder structure
   - Reason: Maintains clean organization for maintainability

## Technical Considerations

- Used Manifest V3 as required by Chrome for modern extensions
- Created a minimal service worker script that will be expanded in later steps
- Implemented a simple, informative popup UI
- Set up placeholder for extension icons

## Future Work

- Implement context menu functionality (Step 2)
- Add event listeners for user interactions (Step 3)
- Develop video ID extraction logic (Step 4)
- Create download functionality (Step 5)
- Enhance popup UI (Step 6)

## Known Issues
