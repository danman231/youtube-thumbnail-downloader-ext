# YouTube Thumbnail Downloader - Documentation

## Changes Summary

### March 30, 2023 - Initial Setup (Step 1)

1. Created `manifest.json` (lines 1-14)
   - Defined extension metadata with Manifest V3
   - Added required permissions: "contextMenus", "downloads"
   - Configured service worker and popup
   - Referenced icon files
   - Reason: Establishes the core configuration for Chrome extension functionality

2. Created empty `background.js` (lines 1-3)
   - Added placeholder comments for future implementation
   - Reason: Will contain context menu and download functionality in subsequent steps

3. Created `popup.html` (lines 1-19)
   - Built basic HTML structure
   - Added inline CSS for styling
   - Included simple user instructions
   - Reason: Provides user interface when extension icon is clicked

4. Created `icons/` directory
   - Added `README.txt` with instructions for icon creation
   - Reason: Placeholder for extension icons needed at various resolutions

5. Updated directory structure
   - Organized files according to Chrome extension best practices
   - Created future-proof folder structure
   - Reason: Maintains clean organization for maintainability

### March 30, 2023 - Add Context Menu Item (Step 2)

1. Updated `background.js` (lines 1-12)
   - Added implementation for context menu creation
   - Used chrome.runtime.onInstalled event listener
   - Configured menu to appear only for YouTube thumbnails using targetUrlPatterns
   - Reason: Enables the core right-click functionality for YouTube thumbnails

2. Created `create_icons.js` script (lines 1-24)
   - Added Node.js script to generate placeholder icon files
   - Created transparent PNG files for the required icon sizes (16px, 48px, 128px)
   - Reason: Required for extension loading as manifest.json references these icon files

3. Generated placeholder icon files
   - Created icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png in the icons/ directory
   - Used minimalist transparent PNGs as temporary placeholders
   - Reason: Allows extension to load in Chrome without icon-related errors

### March 30, 2023 - Fix Context Menu for YouTube Previews (Step 2 Update)

1. Updated `background.js` (lines 1-21)
   - Added a second context menu item with different triggers
   - Expanded contexts to include "link" and "video" elements
   - Added documentUrlPatterns to target YouTube pages specifically
   - Reason: Addresses the issue where video previews prevented the context menu from appearing

### March 30, 2023 - Implement Context Menu Click Handler (Step 3)

1. Updated `background.js` (lines 1-34)
   - Renamed context menu items for clarity:
     - "Download YouTube Thumbnail (Image)" for static images
     - "Download YouTube Thumbnail (Video)" for links and video elements
   - Added click event handler using chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener
   - Implemented separate handling for image vs. video/link thumbnail types
   - Added fallback URL detection to ensure URLs are properly captured
   - Reason: Enables the extension to respond to user clicks and capture the necessary URL data for further processing

## Technical Considerations

- Used Manifest V3 as required by Chrome for modern extensions
- Created a minimal service worker script that will be expanded in later steps
- Implemented a simple, informative popup UI
- Set up placeholder for extension icons
- Used chrome.contextMenus.create with targetUrlPatterns to filter for YouTube thumbnails
- Leveraged chrome.runtime.onInstalled to ensure menu is created at the right time
- Added multiple context menu items with different triggers to handle YouTube's autoplay preview feature
- Used onClicked event listener to capture user interactions
- Added console logging for debugging purposes

## Future Work

- Add video ID extraction logic (Step 4)
- Create download functionality (Step 5)
- Enhance popup UI (Step 6)
- Replace placeholder icons with proper designed icons

## Known Issues

- Icon files are minimal placeholders, not proper designed icons
- The context menu for video previews may capture different URL formats requiring additional processing
