## Current Status
- Basic extension structure is in place
- Files created or updated:
  - manifest.json
  - background.js (with context menu implementation, click handler, video ID extraction, and download functionality)
  - popup.html (enhanced with improved UI and detailed instructions)
  - icons/ directory with placeholder icon files
  - create_icons.js (script to generate placeholder icons)
- Context menus implemented:
  - "Download Thumbnail (from Image)" for static thumbnail images
  - "Download Thumbnail (from Video)" for videos and links on YouTube pages
- Download functionality:
  - Successfully extracts video IDs from various URL formats including direct links and page URLs
  - Generates high-quality thumbnail URLs using the video ID
  - Downloads images to the user's download folder with descriptive filenames
  - Provides error handling and console logging for debugging
- Popup UI:
  - Provides step-by-step instructions for using the extension
  - Features improved styling and readability
  - Includes details about file format, save location, and supported page types
- Testing confirms functionality on:
  - YouTube video pages
  - YouTube search results
  - Video thumbnails with different URL patterns including blob URLs

## Next Steps
- Consider future enhancements:
  - Add options for selecting different thumbnail qualities
  - Create proper designed icons to replace placeholders
  - Add localization support for multiple languages
  - Implement thumbnail quality verification before download

## Technical Debt / Issues
- Current icon files are minimal placeholders and should be replaced with proper designed icons
- No option yet for users to select different thumbnail qualities
- No mechanism to verify if higher quality thumbnails exist before downloading

## Testing Status
- Extension has been loaded in Chrome in Developer mode
- Extension appears in the list of installed extensions
- Context menu items appear when right-clicking on appropriate YouTube elements
- Context menu items do not appear when right-clicking on non-YouTube images
- Downloads function successfully initiates and saves files to the user's download folder
- Downloaded files have correct naming pattern and contain the expected thumbnails
- Video ID extraction works for multiple URL formats:
  - Standard YouTube watch URLs (youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
  - YouTube thumbnail image URLs (ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID)
  - Blob URLs (using fallback to page URL extraction)
- Popup UI displays correctly and provides accurate instructions
